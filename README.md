# POS 2.0 

This project stared out as a grade 12 school project. It used to use MS Access databases but has since been converted to support MYSQL.
I decided to release this application as open source software and will in my free time continue to try and improve it. 

Right now this system supports windows only (Driver Requirements). You can try and run it on linux using WINE but no support can be guaranteed for that. 

If you have any suggestions on how to improve the application let me know and we can work on improving the application together. Please note I am no expert programmer and am still learning a lot everyday.
